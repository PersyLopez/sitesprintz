✅ DRAFT → PAYMENT → PUBLISH FLOW COMPLETE!

The complete end-to-end flow is now working:

1️⃣ User chooses template → Customizes site
2️⃣ Clicks 'Save Draft (Free)' → Draft saved without payment
3️⃣ Clicks 'Publish Now' → Payment modal appears
4️⃣ User enters email, selects plan → Payment processed
5️⃣ Draft converts to published site → Site goes live!

Published sites are accessible at:
- http://yourbusiness-[timestamp].localhost:3000
