    "title": "Frequently Asked Questions",

    "items": [
      {"question": "What industries do you specialize in?", "answer": "We work primarily with manufacturing, technology, retail, and professional services firms. Our team has experience across 15+ industries, and our methodologies adapt to any business looking to scale sustainably."},
      {"question": "How long is a typical engagement?", "answer": "Engagements typically last 4-8 weeks for project-based work, though some clients work with us ongoing as fractional executives or strategic advisors. We'll discuss the right timeline during your discovery call."},
      {"question": "What size companies do you work with?", "answer": "We focus on businesses with $5M-$100M in annual revenue. This allows for meaningful impact while maintaining personalized attention to your unique challenges."},
      {"question": "How is your pricing structured?", "answer": "We offer both project-based and retainer pricing depending on scope. Projects start at $1,200 and typically range from $1,500-$2,500 depending on complexity. Retainers start at $3,000/month. All pricing is transparent and agreed upon before we begin."},
      {"question": "Will I work directly with Dr. Walsh or a team?", "answer": "You work directly with our senior consultants, including Dr. Walsh who oversees all engagements. For larger projects, you'll have a dedicated team, but Dr. Walsh is involved in strategy development and key milestones."},
      {"question": "What results can I expect?", "answer": "While every business is different, clients typically see 20-50% revenue growth, improved operational efficiency, stronger market positioning, and clearer strategic direction. Our case studies showcase specific results achieved with recent clients."},
      {"question": "Do you offer ongoing support after a project ends?", "answer": "Yes! Many clients transition to an advisory retainer for ongoing strategic guidance, quarterly planning sessions, and implementation support. This ensures long-term success."},
      {"question": "How involved will I need to be?", "answer": "We work collaboratively with you and your leadership team. Expect 3-5 hours per week of your time for meetings, feedback, and decision-making. We handle the research, analysis, and heavy lifting."},
      {"question": "Can you help with implementation or just strategy?", "answer": "Both! We're hands-on and can support implementation, or provide a detailed roadmap for your team to execute. We'll determine the right approach based on your needs, resources, and timeline."},
      {"question": "What if I'm not sure what I need?", "answer": "That's exactly what the free 30-minute discovery call is for! We'll discuss your challenges and goals, and provide honest feedback on whether consulting is right for you and what approach makes sense."}
