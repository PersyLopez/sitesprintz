      {"question": "What if my pet is anxious or aggressive?", "answer": "We're experienced with anxious and reactive pets. We use fear-free handling techniques and take breaks as needed. For extremely anxious pets, we may recommend shorter sessions or discuss alternative options."},
      {"question": "What should I bring to the appointment?", "answer": "Just bring your pet on a leash or in a carrier! We provide everything else. If your pet has special dietary needs or medical conditions, please let us know in advance."},
      {"question": "How often should my pet be groomed?", "answer": "It depends on breed and coat type. Most dogs benefit from grooming every 4-8 weeks. We'll provide a personalized recommendation based on your pet's needs."},
      {"question": "Do you groom senior pets?", "answer": "Yes! We take extra care with senior pets, providing frequent breaks, gentle handling, and accommodations for mobility issues or health concerns."},
      {"question": "What if my pet's coat is matted?", "answer": "We can carefully remove mats when possible. Severe matting may require shaving for your pet's comfort and safety. There may be an additional charge depending on severity."},
      {"question": "Do you offer puppy/kitten grooming?", "answer": "Absolutely! We offer special introductory grooming for puppies and kittens to create positive associations with grooming from an early age."},
      {"question": "What products do you use?", "answer": "We use premium, pet-safe products including organic shampoos and conditioners. We can accommodate sensitive skin and allergies with hypoallergenic options."}
