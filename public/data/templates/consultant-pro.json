      {
        "question": "What makes Apex different from other consulting firms?",
        "answer": "We combine Big 3 methodology with hands-on implementation support. Unlike traditional consultants who deliver recommendations and leave, we stay with you to drive results. Our team includes former McKinsey, Bain, and BCG consultants plus Fortune 500 executives."
      },
      {
        "question": "What is your typical engagement length?",
        "answer": "Most engagements run 8-16 weeks, though some are shorter (strategy sprints) or longer (transformation programs). We tailor the timeline to your needs and can work on retainer for ongoing support."
      },
      {
        "question": "Do you work with startups or just established companies?",
        "answer": "We work with companies from Series A startups to Fortune 500s. Our sweet spot is growth-stage companies ($5M-$500M revenue) that need senior-level expertise without the overhead of full-time executives."
      },
      {
        "question": "How do you charge for your services?",
        "answer": "We typically work on fixed-fee project engagements or monthly retainers. For some growth engagements, we're open to performance-based fees. We'll discuss pricing during your consultation based on scope and objectives."
      },
      {
        "question": "Can you provide references?",
        "answer": "Absolutely. We're happy to connect you with past clients in your industry who can speak to their experience working with us and the results achieved."
      },
      {
        "question": "Do you sign NDAs?",
        "answer": "Yes, we sign NDAs and have strict confidentiality protocols. Many of our clients are working on sensitive strategic initiatives, and we take data security seriously."
      },
      {
        "question": "What if we're not satisfied with the work?",
        "answer": "We have a satisfaction guarantee. If you're not satisfied within the first 2 weeks, we'll make it right or part ways amicably. In 11 years, we've never had a client invoke this—our 92% retention rate speaks for itself."
      },
      {
        "question": "Do you implement or just provide recommendations?",
        "answer": "Both! Unlike traditional consultants, we provide hands-on implementation support. We work alongside your team to ensure the strategy becomes reality and delivers results."
