# 💰 PRICING RECOMMENDATION - EXECUTIVE SUMMARY

**Date:** November 14, 2025  
**Status:** 🚨 **ACTION REQUIRED**  
**Issue:** Current pricing too low (undervalued by 78-91%)

---

## 🎯 THE PROBLEM

**You're giving away massive value:**

```
Starter ($10/month actual value: $45-65/month) = 78-85% discount
Pro ($25/month actual value: $228-289/month) = 89-91% discount
Premium ($49/month actual value: $264-417/month) = 81-88% discount
```

**Competitors charge 2-5x more for LESS features:**
- Wix: $27-175/month
- Squarespace: $23-98/month  
- Shopify: $105-288/month
- You: $10-49/month (with MORE features!)

---

## 💡 THE SOLUTION

### **RECOMMENDED: HYBRID PRICING (Phased)**

#### **Phase 1: IMMEDIATE (This Week)**
```

Pro:      $25 (unchanged)   Wait for Phase 1B
