## 💡 PRICING PSYCHOLOGY & STRATEGY

### **Why Your Current Pricing is Hurting You:**

```
Problem 1: PERCEIVED VALUE
  └─ "$10 = cheap/low quality" in customer's mind
  └─ Premium products can't be "cheapest"
  └─ You're competing with Weebly ($10) not Wix/Squarespace

Problem 2: REVENUE CEILING
  └─ Even with 1,000 users at $10 = only $10K/month
  └─ Hard to justify development costs
  └─ Can't fund Phase 1B features with low revenue

Problem 3: CUSTOMER EXPECTATIONS
  └─ Cheap price = cheap support expected
  └─ Hard to upsell from $10 → $25 → $49
  └─ Customers anchor on low price

Problem 4: MARKET POSITIONING
  └─ You're a "budget option" not a "value option"
  └─ Competing on price (race to bottom)
  └─ Not competing on features (your strength!)
```

### **Benefits of Higher Pricing:**

```
Benefit 1: PERCEIVED QUALITY
  └─ $29-59-119 = "professional tool"
  └─ Attracts serious business owners
  └─ Positions you with Wix/Squarespace, not Weebly

Benefit 2: REVENUE GROWTH
  └─ 500 users × $24 avg = $12K/month (vs $6K)
  └─ Funds development (Phase 1B, Phase 2)
  └─ Enables better support & infrastructure

Benefit 3: CUSTOMER QUALITY
  └─ Attracts committed customers
  └─ Lower churn (invested more)
  └─ Better feedback & engagement

Benefit 4: COMPETITIVE POSITIONING
  └─ "More features for less money" (vs Wix at $27)
  └─ Not "cheapest option" (vs Weebly at $10)
  └─ Premium brand with accessible pricing

  ✅ Free trial removes risk
Analysis:
  └─ Even with 25% lower conversion, revenue is still +104% higher
```

### **Risk 3: Market Perception**

```
Risk: Seen as "expensive" for small businesses
Mitigation:
  ✅ Emphasize value vs competitors
  ✅ "Save $20/month vs Wix + Apps"
  ✅ ROI calculator on landing page
  ✅ Case studies showing business growth
  ✅ 14-day free trial (no risk)
```

### **Risk 4: Timing**

```
Risk: Raising prices before Phase 1B complete
Mitigation:
  ✅ Launch new pricing WITH Phase 1B deployment
  ✅ "Pro features now include X, Y, Z..."
  ✅ Justify increase with new features
  ✅ Starter stays at Phase 1A features
Alternative:
  └─ Raise Starter now ($24), delay Pro/Premium until Phase 1B
```
