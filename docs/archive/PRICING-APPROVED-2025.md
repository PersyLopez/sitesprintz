## 📧 CUSTOMER COMMUNICATION

### **Email to Existing Users (Grandfathering):**

```
Subject: Thank You - Your Pricing is Locked In Forever 🎉

Hi [First Name],

I have some exciting news to share.

As we've grown SiteSprintz and added more features (trust signals, 
SEO optimization, contact forms, and much more), we've realized 
we've been significantly undercharging for the value we deliver.

Starting [DATE], our pricing will be:
  • Starter: $15/month (was $10)
  • Pro: $45/month (was $25)
  • Premium: $100/month (was $49)

But here's the thing...

YOU believed in us early. You trusted us when we were just getting 
started. And we don't forget that.

So here's what we're doing for you:

✅ YOUR PRICING IS LOCKED IN FOREVER

That's right. As long as you stay subscribed, you'll NEVER see a 
price increase. Your current rate ($10, $25, or $49) is yours to 
keep. Forever.

No fine print. No "for the first year only." Just our way of saying 
thank you for being part of our journey.

Keep building amazing things,
[Your Name]
SiteSprintz Team

P.S. If you know anyone who might benefit from SiteSprintz, now is 
a great time to refer them before the new pricing takes effect!
```
