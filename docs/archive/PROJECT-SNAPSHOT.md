## 🏗️ WHAT'S NEXT

```
DECISION POINT: Choose Your Path

Option A (RECOMMENDED): Deploy Phase 1A First
  → 1-2 weeks to validate with real users
  → Lower risk, get feedback
  → Start revenue ($9/month)
  → Then begin Phase 1B

Option B: Start Phase 1B Immediately
  → 4 weeks to complete all Pro features
  → Faster to $29/month Pro tier
  → Higher risk (no production validation yet)
  → Ship everything together
